On this web application the user is able to select an emotion click on a button and then a div pops up with a cat gif or meme which reflects the
selected Emotion. It's also possible to click a button which selects a random gif which is then also shown in a div that pops up.(style.property.display)

For that to work I mainly used the .filter() method and .includes() method

So far this is one of the bigger JavaScript Projects i have done and it felt really good to use all those methods successfully on a single project


In this project I exercised the mentioned 
- filter() and 
- includes() method but also 
- classList.remove 
- querySelector and 
- getElementsByClassName
